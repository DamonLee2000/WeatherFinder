# WeatherFinder
 Initial Vision:
The project aimed to create a user interface where users could input a city's zip code and country, 
and the backend would fetch and display weather information through interactions with a third-party API. 
This user-centric approach was intended to provide an interactive experience for users.

Revised Goals:
As development progressed, the project's focus shifted towards becoming a RESTful service designed to handle requests from other clients. 
The new goal is to create robust endpoints for clients to connect to, allowing them to retrieve weather-related data. 
The focus is on building a backend system capable of efficiently handling and processing requests.
